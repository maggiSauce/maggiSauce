## Hello Traveller ğŸ‘‹
I am a second year Computing Sciences student at the University of Alberta and am a volunteer Software Team member for AlbertaSAT.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning database management, computer architecture and algorithms
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a GPS command handler for AlbertaSAT
- âš¡ Fun fact: I won my first ever hackathon along with my team creating UAlberta Course Prerequisite Finder and have turned it into a website with over 1000 visits!
